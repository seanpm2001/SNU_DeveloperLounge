Google is currently dominating in the techology industry. They are using their power for evil.
At the moment, it is impossible to fully escape Googles monopoly. If you want to view a video, unfortunately, it likely won't be on something like Vimeo or dailymotion, you would have to go through Google
- cut this out - If you wanted to have a high-end phone, but didn't want to pay too much, you would have to buy an Android phone
Someone needs to stop this monopoly.
