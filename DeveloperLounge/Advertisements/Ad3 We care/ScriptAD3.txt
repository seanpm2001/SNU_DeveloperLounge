With Googles monopoly, everyone is just a product to them. Google does not care about its users or its community, the only things it cares about is money.
If they didn't like you for a particular reason, they are going to try their best to censor you and bring you down, as you are a threat to their multi-billion dollar income
They only try to fix the problems with their platformers, when their advertisers, the core of their company, get upset.
They have done nothing helpful about any of the situations. Eventually, they are just going to say its ok again, and the money will start rolling in again.
There is so much wrong with Google and its platforms. They don't fix the issues entirely, or even halfway.
They don't even care about their community
With SNU, we are trying to undo Googles current position. We will listen to the community, and actually fix the issues. We put the community first, always.
If an advertiser leaves, we are not going to punish everyone on our platforms for it. We will actually work to fix it. We won't just say that it's ok when it's not.
We need an alternate. We care. Choose SNU.
